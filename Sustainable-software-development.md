# Sustainable software development

Sustainable software development is software development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future programmers to deliver business value.

# How?

Less frameworks, less code, separation of essential complexity (business logic) from accidental complexity (any other code).

Contrast with "short term" changes.
