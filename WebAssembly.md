# WebAssembly

[WebAssembly](http://webassembly.org/) or wasm is a new portable, size- and load-time-efficient format suitable for compilation to the web.  It's an open standard supported by Mozilla, Google and Microsoft.  [WebAssembly](http://webassembly.org/) is a development of asm.js and aims to allow web pages to be developed in many programming languages, not just Javascript.

C and C++ are the initial cross compilation targets, with GC being added later to support things like Java and C#.

In a few years we should be able to develop websites in something other and Javascript!
