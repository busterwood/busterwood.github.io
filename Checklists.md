# Checklists

Checklists are a surprisingly effective way of ensuring quality on repeated processes.

There are two styles of checklists:
* **Do-Confirm**, i.e. do the all the actions first then use the checklist as a final step
* **Read-Do**, i.e. use the list as the process, checking off each item as you go

The Checklist Manifesto contains a number of stories of successful use of checklists, including:
* hospital, both routine and emergency
* aviation, both routine and emergency
* construction, both planning and communication

Checklists need to be clear and simple, so they need to be tested and refined in the real world.  Checklists should be edited to contains only the key steps that need to be done, and ideally, should fit on a single page.
