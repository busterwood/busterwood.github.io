## DryIoc
[DryIoc](https://bitbucket.org/dadhi/dryioc) is a very fast DI container which also has a MEF compatibility layer.

## MEF 
[MEF](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.componentmodel.composition(v=vs.110).aspx) was created for plugins, specfically Visual Studio, and supports changes while the program is running (recomposition).  [MEF](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.componentmodel.composition(v=vs.110).aspx) can be used as a DI container but is a pain-in-the-a** when composition goes wrong.

## MEF2
[MEF2](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj635137(v=vs.110).aspx) is a lightweight version of MEF, which has been optimized for static composition scenarios and provides faster compositions.
