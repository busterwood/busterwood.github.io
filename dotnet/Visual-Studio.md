* [Viasfora](http://viasfora.com/) for nice editor colours
* [VSColorOutput](http://mike-ward.net/vscoloroutput/) for highlighting errors and warnings in the Output window
* [Roslynator](https://github.com/JosefPihrt/Roslynator) which has lots of refactorings and analyzers
* [EditorEnhancements](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MadsKristensen.EditorEnhancements) for editor sorting and *To Title Case*.
