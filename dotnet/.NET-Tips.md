# .NET Tips

# InternalsVisibleTo

Use can add the `InternalsVisibleToAttribute` to an assembly to allow unit tests to access assembly internal classes and methods.

Sign assemblies must specify the full public key in the `InternalsVisibleToAttribute`.

## How to get the public key of a signed assembly

1. Extract the public key to a file: `sn –p <keyfile.snk> <keyfile.snk.PublicKey>`
2. Show the public key on the console: `sn –tp <keyfile.snk.PublicKey>`

# Assembly Binding errors

If you are getting problems starting a .NET process because you are getting assembly loading errors, then use `fuslogvw.exe` to [enable logging of assembly binding failures](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/e74a18c4(v=vs.110).aspx).

# Array bounds checks

See [Array Bounds Check Elimination in the CLR](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/clrcodegeneration/2009/08/13/array-bounds-check-elimination-in-the-clr/), but in brief:
* `for` loops on arrays that just loop from 0 to length avoid bounds checks
* `foreach` loops on arrays avoid bounds checks (in Release mode)
* `for` loops with any other logic (or other loops, e.g. `while`) incur bounds checks
