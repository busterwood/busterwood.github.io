# Heap and Garbage 

The Microsoft .NET runtime has a generational garbage collector that has four area of memory:

1. Gen0 - a "small" sized area of memory. New objects are created here (unless they are very big, see large object heap below)
1. Gen1 - a "medium" sized area of memory.  If an Gen0 object survives a garbage collection it is moved to Gen1.
1. Gen2 - a "large" sized area of memory.  If an Gen1 object survives a garbage collection it is moved to Gen2.
1. Large Object Heap (LOH) - all "large" (85K or more) objects are create here and not moved.  Typically contains large arrays.  The LOH is never compacted, unless you [enable a switch introduced in .NET 4.5.1](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.runtime.gcsettings.largeobjectheapcompactionmode%28v=vs.110%29.aspx)

Generational garbage collectors work well in two scenarios:

1. Object are created and have a short life time, i.e. they never get out of Gen0, they die young
1. Object are created and live a long time, i.e. they move to Gen2 and stay alive

Generation garbage collectors _dont_ work so well when objects live for a medium amount of time, e.g. a couple of minutes.  Then you will likely experience high garbage collection CPU which will impact performance.

## Garbage collectors

The default GC used depends on what type of application your have developed.

* the [workstation GC](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee787088%28v=vs.110%29.aspx#workstation_and_server_garbage_collection) is the default for windows and console applications
* the [server GC](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee787088%28v=vs.110%29.aspx#workstation_and_server_garbage_collection) is the default for ASP.NET applications and can be used on servers dedicated to a single process.
* 4.6.2 added a [middle ground between server and client GC](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/maoni/2018/10/02/middle-ground-between-server-and-workstation-gc/) that limits the CPUs used in server GC mode.

[Concurrent GC](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee787088%28v=vs.110%29.aspx#concurrent_garbage_collection) is an option for that allows applications to be more responsive by only suspending thread during Gen0 and Gen1 collections and running Gen2 collections on a background thread.

[Background GC](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee787088%28v=vs.110%29.aspx#background_garbage_collection) was introduced in .NET 4 for workstation GC and .NET 4.5 for server GC. It is similar to concurrent GC but it also allows Gen0 and Gen1 collections to occur whilst a Gen2 collection is in progress. 

[.NET 4.6.2 introduced some improvements](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/alphageek/2017/01/24/significant-garbage-collector-changes-in-net-4-6-2/) to the GC for objects near pinned objects and G2 free space.

## Monitoring Garbage Collection

The easiest way to see an overview of what is happening in a process view the performance counters of a process, and the easiest way to do that is to use [Process Explorer](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-gb/sysinternals/bb896653.aspx) and view the properties of a .NET process and change to the ".NET Performance" tab:

![Process Explorer .NET tab page](https://github.com/busterwood/wiki/blob/master/process-explorer.png)

Process explorer is an easy way to get an overview of GC, to get more information it is recommended that you **trace ETW events**: [part 1](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/maoni/2014/12/22/gc-etw-events-1/), [part 2](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/maoni/2014/12/25/gc-etw-events-2/), [part 3](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/maoni/2014/12/25/gc-etw-events-3/) and [part 4](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/maoni/2014/12/30/gc-etw-events-4/)

Also see [Maoni's blog](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dougste/2010/02/18/an-index-to-maonis-blog-posts-about-the-gc/) for more information "straight from the horses mouth" as she is the main GC developer.

## Profiling memory

There are several tools for profiling the memory of a .NET process, my favourite for many years has been [dotMemory](https://www.jetbrains.com/dotmemory/) from [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/).  The profiler allows you to:

+ take a snapshot of process memory at a point in time
+ compares two snapshots

Visual Studio 2012 Professional now includes a [memory allocation profiler](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dotnet/archive/2013/04/04/net-memory-allocation-profiling-with-visual-studio-2012.aspx).

## Performance profiling

[dotTrace](https://www.jetbrains.com/profiler/) has been my performance profiling tool of choice for many years, and has options for:

+ sampling with low performance impact
+ tracing with high performance impact but accuracy
+ comparing traces

Visual Studio has had a [performance profiler](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/z9z62c29(v=vs.110).aspx) built-in for a while now, but has only been available in the ~~ridiculously expensive~~ Enterprise edition.

## Dump Analysis

What do you do if a production system is misbehaving?  Panic?  No, take a [dump of the process](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/debugger/archive/2009/12/30/what-is-a-dump-and-how-do-i-create-one.aspx) then analyse it using WinDbg (see below).

My preferred method to taking a process dump is to use [Process Explorer](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-gb/sysinternals/bb896653.aspx) which has an menu option **for taking a full dump**:

![Right-click in process explorer](https://github.com/busterwood/wiki/blob/master/create-dump.png)

There is also a Windows API you can called to [create a dump for a process](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms680360%28v=vs.85%29.aspx).

Okay, now you have a process dump, what do you do with it? 

1. Run WinDbg part of the [Debugging Tools for Windows](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff551063%28v=vs.85%29.aspx)
1. Load the dump file (see the File menu)
1. Load [SOS.dll extension](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb190764.aspx) that supports debugging CLR processes
1. [Use SOS](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-au/magazine/cc164138.aspx) to view the threads, objects, classes, etc

## JIT and beyond 
The Microsoft CLR has a few different Just-In-Time compliers and options:
+ x86 JIT
+ [x64 JIT that supports Tail Recursive functions](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/clrcodegeneration/archive/2009/05/11/tail-call-improvements-in-net-framework-4.aspx) in F#, but suprisingly the JIT also [supports tail recurive functions in C#](http://community.bartdesmet.net/blogs/bart/archive/2010/07/07/the-case-of-the-failed-demo-stackoverflowexception-on-x64.aspx)
+ the new and [much faster RyuJIT x64](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dotnet/archive/2013/09/30/ryujit-the-next-generation-jit-compiler.aspx?PageIndex=2) is close to release and supports [SIMD functions for Vectors](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/clrcodegeneration/archive/2014/05/12/ryujit-ctp4-now-with-more-simd-types-and-better-os-support.aspx)

The Microsoft CLR JITs methods the first time they are encountered, and the current implementation does not change machine code once a method has been JITed.  Of course you can skip some of the startup JIT cost by NGEN-ing your application, if you so wish.  And if you use .NET 4.5 or above you get [multi-core JIT support built in](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/hh882452.aspx) via the [ProfileOptmization](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.runtime.profileoptimization(v=vs.110).aspx) class.

### .NET Native

.NET 4.6 includes support for [native compilation of .NET applications](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn584397(v=vs.110).aspx) into executable code.  A small caveat is it will only work when deployed to Windows 10, so its not much use for business applications yet.  The startup JIT cost is eliminated, but there is [some evidence](http://java.dzone.com/articles/net-native-performance-and) that the resulting executable cost is not as well optimized as the existing JIT complier.

## AnyCPU, x86, x64, prefer 32bit?

[As explained in this Microsoft blog](http://blogs.microsoft.co.il/sasha/2012/04/04/what-anycpu-really-means-as-of-net-45-and-visual-studio-11/) there are now multiple "AnyCPU" options:

* AnyCPU - 32 or 64 bit when run, Intel or ARM
* AnyCPU prefer 32 bit - which runs as 32bit on x64 systems when possible
* x86 - 32bit Intel only
* x64 - 64bit Intel only
