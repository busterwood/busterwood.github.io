# Testing

h1. Unit Testing

* [NUnit](http://nunit.org/) for C#
* [JUnit](http://junit.org/) for Java
* [tSQLt](http://tsqlt.org/) for testing SQL Server
* Go has [unit testing built-in](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#Testing)

h1. Acceptance Testing

There is good advice on what makes a good or bad test from the [Concordion FAQ page](http://concordion.org/technique/java/markdown/).
* [SpecFlow](http://www.specflow.org/) for C#
* [Concordian](http://concordion.org/) for C# and Java
* A few years ago I used [Fitnesse](http://fitnesse.org/) for wiki-like tests
