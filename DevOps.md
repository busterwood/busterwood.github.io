# DevOps

*DevOps* is not a well-defined term, but I think of it as systems and tools that get features from source code into production quickly and cheaply, while ensuring quality.

*DevOps* is also the Development team and Operations team working together.  Cross-team collaboration and communication are key.

*DevOps* is a culture, not a job.  An organisation embraces a *DevOps* culture, it does not delegate *DevOps* work to certain roles. *DevOps* is about embracing failure and using it as an opportunity to improve.
