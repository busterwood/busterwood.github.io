# Natural State

The natural state of a large software system is to be coded with *different* patterns and ideas.

Any non-trivial software system will be built by as a number of components, with each component built by one or more individuals, leading to differences straight away.
Over time ideas of best practice change, so new ideas are added, typically to some subset of components.  New components may also be added with different ideas of what is best practice at that time.

This has parallels on the work of the architect Christopher Alexander, who saw buildings are organic people centric things, in which buildings would have a master plan to divide into areas, but the details of each area would be different.
