# Strategic verses tactical

### Tactical programming

If your main focus is to get something working, e.g. a feature or bug fix, then this is *tactical* programming.  Short-sighted businesses often reward tactical programming, measuring the time to delivery of each feature or bug fix.  Tactical programming is *how systems become complicated,* because tactical programming is not thinking about the future, it is focused on the here and now.

### Strategic programming

> Working code is not enough.

If your goal more long term then you can choose to focus on good design and consider alternatives based on their merits.  *Strategic programming* is about investing good system design. Proactive design is upfront, a reactive design is known as *technical debt*.

> If you are not making the design better, you are probably making it worse.

### How much to invest

10-20% of total development time.
