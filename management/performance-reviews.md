# Performance Reviews

Annual performance goals and reviews are a fact of many organisations.  If feedback is being given continuously then these sessions should be short with no surprises.  It's good to review quarterly so what has happened is fresh in peoples minds.

### No surprises

If feedback is being given continuously then these sessions should be short with no surprises.  

### Get feedback before giving

Ask for feedback on how you, the manager, is doing before giving feedback to your direct report.

### Write it down

Writing helps to clarify what you want to say, and also means you can't "chicken-out" in the face-to-face meeting.  It also helps to give the written feedback to the employee, so it can be referred to later if points need clarifying.

### Give time to digest?

People work differently, some will work with receiving the review in a meeting, some would prefer to have information before a review meeting in order to prepare for the meeting.

### Allow time

Allow at least 50 minutes per review.  Don't try to fit reviews in "back to back" as they can be emotionally draining.

### Look backwards and forwards

Spend half the time looking at what has happened, half on looking forwards and planning changes.

### Compensation

If possible, separate reviews from compensation discussions.  If compensation is discussed up front then people may not fully engage with the review process.

## Poor performance

If someone is not performing well in their current role then it's could be for personal reasons, give them time and support to sort it out.  For example, are they getting enough exercise and sleep?  

Another reason for poor performance is it could be the wrong role for that person.  Try finding them a new role, within the team, in another team or elsewhere.  If you have trust between manager and employee then this conversation is possible.
