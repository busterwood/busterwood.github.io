# General Management
If things are to get better then we need to be able to freely give and receive guidance.

Just as agile development is about shortening feedback loops, guidance is best given and received continuously and as soon as possible after the event has taken place.

## Giving guidance

One way of framing guidance is:
1. the situation you saw
2. the behaviour, good or bad
3. the impact you observed

"When *this happened* you did xxx that lead to yyy".

The guidance conversation should take no more than 2-3 minutes.

"Praise in public, criticise in private" is a well-known mantra, but some introverts may prefer praise in private.

## Receiving guidance

Listen, don't defend, understand what they are saying and then acknowledge the other person's viewpoint and feelings.
If you don't agree with the criticism then give your reasons and schedule a time to follow up.

### Reward criticism

Just as we learn more from our failures, we can improve more with more criticism.
