title: "Disfunctions of teams"

From the book "Five Disfunctions of teams" by Patrick Lencioni.

# Absence of Trust

Stems from an unwillingness to be vulnerable within a group. If team members who cannot be open about mistakes and weaknesses then it is impossible to build trust.

# Fear of conflict

Teams that lack trust are incapable of engaging in honest and passionate debate. 

Signs include:
* lack of engagement
* careful discussion, guarded comments
* comments between individuals in private, rather than in the open

# Lack of commitment

Without honest debate, teams will rarely, if ever, commit to group decisions.  Some may feign agreement during meetings.

# Avoidance of accountability 

Without real commitment and buy in, team members find it hard to hold each other accountable, and find it hard to tell team members about actions or behaviours that seem counter productive.  See [feedback](feedback).

# Inattention to results

This is putting personal goals, ego, career development, or "department" above the goals to the team.

Who's team is your number one?  Engineering?  Data Science?  Or your company/project?
