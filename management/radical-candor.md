# Summary of Radical Candor

## Radical Candor isn’t brutal honesty

It means to share your (humble) opinions directly, rather than talking badly about people behind their backs.Radical Candor happens at the intersection of *Care Personally* and *Challenge Directly*. 

*Care Personally* means that you care about the other person, not about whether you are winning a popularity contest. 

*Challenge Directly* means that you share your perspective and invite the other person to do the same.

## PLAY THE SCENE YOU’RE IN

Radical Candor is measured not at the speaker's mouth, but at the listener’s ear; it’s not what you say, it’s how the other person hears it.

When giving praise or criticism, pay attention to how the other person is responding, and adjust accordingly.If a person gets emotional, this is your cue to demonstrate you Care Personally.  Show some compassion.

If the person is not hearing you or keeps ignoring what you’re saying, this is your cue to Challenge more Directly; to be more clear. Remember, it’s not mean, it’s clear.
