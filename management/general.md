# General Management

Managers weeks might be a mixture of:
* 2 days - planned work
* 2 days - unplanned work (helping with issues that come up)
* 1 day - people management

## Look after yourself

As a manager, you need to be fit and healthy, with a good work/life balance. You need to care about yourself before caring for others.  Figure out what works for you and stick to it, don't drop exercise, meditation, or getting home to see the kids when things get tough.  Schedule time in your calendar to look after yourself. Be your best self at home and at work.

## Trust

Management starts with trust, both getting and receiving trust.  How do we build trust?  By taking the time to get to know people, both personally and professionally. Managers need to lead the way, opening up about themselves and their struggles in life.  

There can only be real trust when people *feel free* at work, the first step to this is relinquishing unilateral control.  The job of a manager is then to set the rules, standards and process to avoid *anarchy*, which is just as destructive dictatorial control.

Respect peoples values.  Never try to convinse someone that your values are *right* and theirs are *wrong*!   Open yourself to peoples values and opinions, learn from there experiences.

Respect peoples personal space, don't be overfamiliar, especially with the opposite sex, but offer a hug when appropriate :-)

## Feedback

Much like agile development, management needs to a continuous process, not a big bang "once-a-year" thing.
Feedback is a two-way thing, managers need to invite feedback as well as giving feedback.  Managers need to praise as well as offering opportunities to improve.

## Listening

Listening to people is a key management skill, talking a lot and interrupting is not good management.

## One-to-one

One to one time between managers and employees needs to happen several times a month, weekly is possible.  This is the employee's time to talk, managers should be *listening* and offering help and solutions.  Complaining about other team members is not allowed, problems should be discussed directly with other team members without the manager.

One-to-one sessions help to build *trust*.

## Team makeup

Teams need a mixture of people, with mixed ideas and mixed perspectives. It is good to have some ambitious people along with others who want to stay doing what they are doing.

## Don't tell people what to do

Telling smart people what to do does not work, it just pisses them off, so how does the team [[get stuff done|getting stuff done]]?

## Performance reviews

Annual [[performance reviews]] are a fact of many organisations.  If feedback is being given continuously then these sessions should be short with no surprises.  It's good to review quarterly so what has happened is fresh in peoples minds.

## No bitching

It's not a managers job to mediate between direct-reports.  Insist people talk directly with each other, without the manager.  If they really can't manage that then offer to have a three-way conversation.  Bitching to the boss is not allowed.
