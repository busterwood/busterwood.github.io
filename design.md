Take some extra time to come up with an alternative to the initial design.  Thinking about an alternative does not need to take long, e.g. one or two hours, but will often lead to a better overall design.

Don't implement the first idea that comes into your head - smart people often do - software is hard so its impossible for even the smartest people to get everything right on the first attempt.
