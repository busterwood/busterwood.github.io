If the time if 11 am and I feel the need for a snack then I will eat nuts, fruit or olives, which release energy slowly.

If the time if 3 pm and I feel the need for a snack then I will eat nuts, fruit or olives, which release energy slowly.

If the time 10 minutes before an hour, e.g. 9.50, then I will take a 10 minute break.

If the time is 7 am on Monday, Wednesday or Friday then I will do HIT exercise on the our exercise bike.

If I feel tired in the afternoon then I will make sure to cancel a 30 minute meeting so I can have a 20 minute rest.

If the time is 9.30 pm then I will turn off the TV and start going to bed (the kids often wake us at 6am).
