# Software developer rules

These are the rules of software development that work in many organisations:

Must learn fashionable tech, not reinvent your own version of the wheel again.

Must listen to what is being asked for and deliver that.

Any ideas that might improve things go on a list and get discussed with the manager/lead first.

Ask for feedback once a week, what's working, what is not.

Ask for a review whenever a task seems hard or long.

Ask for permission to try something in a time box.

Focus on time for a feature, just good enough, not perfection.

Follow fashion, try tech at home, 1/2 day every 2 weeks?

Full stack is better as most roles require it.

Invest in books, sharpen the saw, one a month or 2 months?

Practice code reading, learn to map and understand.

Exercise and get sleep.

Enjoy friendships at work and home, its not all about work.

Learn the business and add to a personal wiki.

Review these rules every Monday until they are second nature.
