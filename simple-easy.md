title: "Simple is not easy"
---

Rich Hickey has a great talk call "[simple is not easy](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy)" ([transcript](https://github.com/matthiasn/talk-transcripts/blob/master/Hickey_Rich/SimpleMadeEasy.md)).

## Simple

The roots of the work **simple** mean "one fold or braid".  The opposite of simple is complex, which means "many braids".  

* Things with multiple tasks, roles, dimensions or responsibilities are **complex**, they are intertwined.
* Things with one task, role, dimension or responsibility are **simple**.  *NOTE* does mean *one instance* or *one class*.

**Simple is measurable**.

## Easy

The roots of the word **easy** come from "to lie near", i.e. 
* **Easy** things are close at hand, familiar, near are capabilties
* **Hard** things are unfamiliar, far away, outside of our current knowledge or experience.

**Easy is relative**.
