# Consistency

Consistency means in the reader can learn a pattern once and then perceive how another part of the system works.  Consistency creates leverage to reduce cognitive load.  If a system is not consistent then developers will need to learn more, which costs more and slows things down.

Consistent:
* Names
* Coding style - preferably enforced by a tool
* Design patterns - use of the same patterns will help
* Invariants - reduces special cases

### Document

Document the conventions, e.g. in a wiki.  If you don't write conventions down then you can't expect people to follow them.

### Enforce

Write or use an existing tool to check the conventions are being followed.

### Don't change

Once conventions have been set don't change them, the extra complexity introduced is not worth it.
