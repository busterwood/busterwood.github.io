title: "Problem Solving"

From the remarkable book [Are Your Lights On?](http://amzn.eu/1FL7tJI) By Donald C Gause and Gerald M Weinberg, 1982

# What is the Problem?

* Who has the problem - many people will answer
* What is the essence of your problem - ask each person

# What's your problem?
> A problem is the difference between things as _desired_ and things as _perceived_

* Phantom problems are perception problems, but
* Phantom problems are real problems

Don't bother to try to solve problems for people who don't have a sense of humor, it's not worth the effort.

# What is _the_ problem?
* Don't take their solution method as for a problem definition, i.e. think of your own solution
* If you solve their problem too readily, they'll never believe you've solved their real problem
* Don't take their solution method as for a problem definition - _especially if it's your own solution method_
* You can never be sure you have the correct definition, even _after_ the problem is solved
* Don't leap to conclusions, but don't ignore your first impression (often your instincts are insight)
* You can never be sure you have the correct definition, but don't ever stop trying to get one

# What is the problem really?
* Each solution is the source of the next problem
* The trickiest part of certain problems is just recognizing their existence
* If you can't think of at least three things that _might_ be wrong with your understanding of the problem, you don't understand the problem
* Test you definition on a foreigner, someone blind, or a child, or make yourself foreign, blind, or childlike
* Each new point of view will produce a new misfit, i.e. something wrong with the solution
* How could we change the problem statement to make the solution different?
* What am I solving?
* As you wander along the weary path of problem definition, check back home once in a while to see if you haven't lost your way
* once you have the problem statement in words, play with the words until the statement is in everyone's head, e.g. change _emphasis_ of the words - "mary had a little lamb"

# Whose problem is it?
* Don't solve other people's problems when they can solve them perfectly well themselves
* If it's there problem, _make_ it their problem
* If a person is in a position to do something about a problem, but doesn't have the problem, then do something so he does
* try blaming yourself for a change - even for a moment

# Where does it come from?
* The source of the problem is most often within you
* In the valley of the problem solvers, the problem creator is King (or president, or Dean)
* Who sent this problem, what's he trying to do to me?
> There's two kinds of people in the world, those that do work and those that make work for others to do.  Keep away from the makeworkers and you'll do alright

# Do we _really_ want to solve it?
* Do unto others as others have done unto you
* In spite of appearances, people seldom know what they want until you give them what they ask for

> We never have enough time to do it right, but we always have enough time to do it over

> We never have enough time to consider whether we want it, but we always have enough time to regret it
